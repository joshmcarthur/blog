  <div class="entry-content"><p>While working at 3Months as a developer, I am also completing a Bachelor of
Business Information Systems at Victoria University. One of the things that
rolls around twice a year and always causes students headaches is the signups
systemÂ - it&#8217;s one of the bragging points of the School of Information
Management at Victoria, as it was build as a project by a group of students
there (Hence the name &#8216;S-Cubed = SSS = SIM Signups System). In itself, it&#8217;s a
good application - it fulfills it&#8217;s brief of managing signups for tutorials and
workshops, and lecturers and students alike seem to have no huge issues using
is. The problem is though, is that its performance under load is crap - it
simply was not build for the load that it receives when tutorial signups for 2
courses of 700 people each opens at 9am, and each of those 1400 people trying
to get the exact tutorial they want are continually refereshing the page and so
exacerbating the server load even more.</p>

<p>This server load doesn&#8217;t just extend to slow page load speed - since the site
has not been build with scalability in mind, there have been ongoing issues
with sessions expiring as people try and signup for a tutorial or workshop,
people stuck halfway through a transaction, and the server even goes down every
now and then.
What I am proposing is an open framework that takes the best aspects of this
type of system, and builds upon it techniques to optimize page load speed, and
increase scalability. It seems to me that Universities in general are lacking a
system that allows them to smoothly run signups (usually they are dependent on
modified forum software, paper signups, emails or proprietary in-house
systems), and so this isÂ definitelyÂ something that is marketable around the
world.
As I see it, here are the base requirements for such a system:</p>

<pre><code>* LDAP and OAuth Authentication so that students do not need to 'register'
  to sign up for a tutorial
* Accurate time-based releases of tutorials and workshops that do not
  require human intervention
* Automatic server load monitoring with the ability to increase allocated
  resources if necessary (i.e. this application is an ideal candidate for
  Rackspace Cloud or Heroku)
* Per-course and per-University analytics for better scheduling of tutorial
  and workshop release times and how students are accessing the system.
* The ability for lecturers and course administrators to export and print
  class lists, tutorial lists, and workshops list with all student data or
  just a subset.
</code></pre>

<p>This project isÂ definitelyÂ going on theÂ work pileÂ for my personal projects
- it&#8217;s got a couple of interesting aspects to it which I haven&#8217;t approached
before (Such as LDAP from Rails), and generally seems to follow along with my
ethos of community-oriented &#8216;responsible web applications&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight I&#8217;ve been playing round with Radiant - it looks really impressive as a
content-management system, and I&#8217;ve been thinking about ways I can change it
round to support vendors - that is, one person or organization offering Radiant
as a service to multiple clients - basically, it would be one big Radiant
application (to simplify administration and server maintenance), but would be
scoped (for administrative users) just to that organization - nothing would be
different from them, aside from the fact that the vendor can use one instance
of the application to create, modify and maintain many organizations&#8217; Radiant
content management systems.Â 
My motivation for doing this is to try and create something I thought of a bit
earlier today - a service to help low-level, low-budget schools (Primary to
Intermediate) to move services and content online in a way that they can manage
themselves. Radiant seems to be an excellent option in this regard - supporting
diverse and flexible themes, and with plenty of extensions to offer additional
functionality for little work. What I want, though, is a sort of dashboard for
myself - I want to have a nice interface to have overall control over each
installation, and for me to administer the site myself if that is a client&#8217;s
preference. In addition, by using the method of scoping a &#8216;site&#8217; to an
organization, some cool things are possible, like an online signup wizard that
would allow a client to set up a site without any initial involvement from me -
because it is just records being inserted into a database, and not an entire
application being created, this type of process becomes very easy.
It&#8217;s early days yet, of course, but something in the educational area is what
I&#8217;ve been wanting to tackle for a while now - let&#8217;s see how it goes.

So I decided this evening to devote a couple of hours to giving back to Spree,
after using the framework for a couple of work projects, and appreciating it
for it&#8217;s flexibility and extensibility.Â 
I&#8217;ve developed an extension for Spree called Import Products. The source is
based on a few bits of code that I have used for 2 projects now to import
products into a Spree store from a comma-seperated values file (.CSV).
It&#8217;s not perfect, but I&#8217;m happy with it as my first ever full contribution back
to the Ruby on Rails community - I hope I have done a good enough job that it
is useful to a couple of people.
If you want to check out the source code, it&#8217;s on github.
If you want to check out a description of the extension, check out the Spree
extension_page.</p>
