  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been working on an image processor class for work, and recently ran into
this issue. I thought I would post it up here as normally I need to be quite
desperate before I start trawling through email mirrors - hopefully somebody
comes across this post first.
If you use ImageMagick (in particular, in conjunction with MiniMagick), then
you may come across this issue, and there is actually a quick fix to it. The
issue itself is as follows: my image processor retrieves an image from an
online source, but the image has a 1 or 2px border, and is thousands of pixels
wide - too wide for web use. I therefore wrote this class to first crop the
border off the image, and then resize it.
If you do actually do this though, there is an important step that needs to go
in-between the cropping and the resizing. If you won&#8217;t do this, you will
basically get a PNG layer that is offset from the image itself - i.e. some or
all of the Â actual image content is not visible. This happens because when the
image is cropped, the origin of the image changes. It needs to be reset back to
coordinates 0, 0 in order to not offset the layer itself when the image is
resized.
Here&#8217;s how to do it.Â 
For Ruby/Minimagick:
image.set(&#8220;page&#8221;, &#8220;#{image[&#8216;width&#8217;]}x#{image[&#8216;height&#8217;]}+0+0&#8221;)
For ImageMagick directly (i.e. in console):
convert [image sequence]: -set page [width]x[height]+0+0
Simple! The image should save correctly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve just added a nice unobtrusive scroll to top feature to my blog, and learnt
an interesting tip in the process I thought I would share, originating from one
of the many problems Twitter has had with it&#8217;s jQuery fanciness.
The scroll to top stuff isn&#8217;t overly complicated - just detect when the user
has scrolled x pixels down the screen, and then show a link to go back to the
top (Which can be animated if you want) - for a nice tutorial on this, check
out_this_tutorial.
The thing is that this technique uses the scroll event (bound to window, but
can be bound to basically anything with a scrollbar). The scroll event gets
fired any time the window is scrolled - but any time the scroll amount changes
at all. What this means is that the scroll event is fired any time scroll
position changes - so if you grab the scrollbar, and pull, the scroll event is
fired every time the bar moves, not when you release the mouse.
John_Resig_reports_that_Twitter_ran_into_some_problems_with_thisÂ - they had a
function bound directly to the scroll event being fired every time anyone
scrolled (at all!). Resig has also reported a nice solution though, which I&#8217;ll
pass on here. It&#8217;s actually quite simple. Instead of binding a complicated
function to the scroll event, you simply set a flag variable to let something
else know that the window has been scrolled. The second piece of the solution
is a function running via setInterval - that is, a function being called on a
scheduled basis. The first task of this function is to check this flag - if it
is set, it can perform any task (Such as showing a &#8216;Back to Top&#8217; link, and set
the flag variable back to false.Â 
The end result of this solution is that you basically have a polling function,
rather than an event-driven one. This is actually a good thing though, when it
comes to this type of event. Instead of having a complex function called every
time the window is scrolled, a function is called every quarter second or so,
and only executes if the window has been scrolledÂ - much better!
I personally used an object variable, rather than just a flag - this object was
populated with the object that was scrolled on, and I then checked if this
object was populated in my polling function (rather than just is true), and
could then use the context it provided in this function. Since then, however, I
have realized that in my case, this object will alwaysbe the window object - so
I may as well have a cheaper variable assignment and just directly refer to the
object in my polling function.</p>

I just found this - it&#8217;s a little promotional thing that the (now non-existent)
VUW (Victoria University of Wellington IT Society) did (Well, me and Eddy) to
try and get people to join up (It worked.) - basically, I built a little IR
pen, and using a Wiimote, we managed to make a nice little giant touchscreen.
Granted, it needed calibrating often, and the correct body posture and hand
position took some finding, but it was definately a fun experiment to try out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can tell that this title alone will irritate a lot of developers out there.
It irritated me as well, until I figured out that sometimes, doing things the
&#8216;wrong&#8217; way is the best/only way. But let me get on with things.
Every now and then, you will come across a scenario where you need to access
something in the controller, from the model. This is so obviously non-MVC that
many will (should) immediately shy away from it, but let me suggest a scenario.
Let&#8217;s say you have users, who should be scoped to a particular subdomain. You
would place a default_scope on the User model (with a Proc, once an issue with
default_scope is resolved), that would automatically add conditions to any
database lookup calls to restrict the found users to those belonging to the
current subdomain. The tricky bit is, of course to get this subdomain. Because
it is a default scope, you don&#8217;t actually &#8216;call&#8217; it - so that rules out passing
parameters. I&#8217;ve come across other suggestions as well, such as using
cattr_accessor (NO! It&#8217;s shared across requests), and storing a value in
Thread.current (Relying on the application using threads in the way you expect
them to = not safe). So far though, the best hint I have seen here, although
extremely anti-doing what I am suggesting, would seem to work.Â 
Basically, the jist of this post was that you could dynamically add methods to
ActiveRecord::Base using an around_filter to access sessions, cookies, params
and the request. Now, I agree that this might be a bit too extreme - if you
really need to access the entire session or cookie hash, for example, you
probably aredoing something wrong. Something that I think isÂ suitable though,
given an appropriate situation, is to use this technique to add an &#8216;accessor&#8217;
to ActiveRecord::Base that returns the value you need in your model - the
current subdomain for instance. This is still non-MVC, but is, I think, a far
more elegant solution that anything else I&#8217;ve seen suggested.</p>
