  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://nzsl.vuw.ac.nz">The Dictionary of New Zealand Sign Language</a> went live
on Friday - it&#8217;s a project that I have worked on with <a href="http://%0Awww.danielsherson.com">Daniel</a>, Chris and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/%0Ajamesarobertson">James R</a>, at 3Months. I attended a launch event at Victoria University
on the Friday, and it really was quite a humbling experience - this dictionary
has been the effort of a team of people for years and years - really, what
3Months has done has just been the tip of the iceberg. It really does seem like
this project has been rewarding - we&#8217;ve taken a comprehensive database of sign
information and images (Built with what seems to be a lot of time and effort by
<a href="http://dave.moskovitz.co.nz/2011/06/24/the-online-dictionary-%0Aof-new-zealand-sign-language/">Dave Moskozitz</a>), and given it a public presence - hopefully,
something that everyone can use - whether it&#8217;s to learn New Zealand Sign
Language, or just to learn how to finger spell names and words. I&#8217;m mostly
posting this in the hope that everyone who reads this goes to check out the
site, and to learn something of this language - give it a spin! <a href="http://nzsl.vuw.ac.nz">http://

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So apparently pass phrases are the new &#8216;secure password&#8217; - kinda the step you
get to when you finally accept that your users are going to use something like
&#8216;password&#8217; for their account password. The natural step here is to reinforce a
secure password strategy by requiring x numbers, x special characters and a
certain length - but I find this really annoying when I just want to get signed
up, and that means that other users do as well. Something I&#8217;ve just been
thinking about is the naming semantics of password field - labeling it
&#8216;password&#8217; immediately prompts users to think of an actual word - if they are
computer-savvy, then they might throw a symbol or number in, but most likely it
will still be based on an actual word. I wonder what would happen if you
labelled this field &#8216;Passphrase&#8217; though? I think it is inevitable that many
users will recognize the pattern of the form rather than the labelling of the
fields and still enter their &#8216;password&#8217;, but just maybe there will be some
users who get the semantics of the label, and enter a sentence, instead of a
word. Even though there may not be special characters in that sentence, it&#8217;s
still just as, if not more secure from dictionary attacks - guessing one word
is pretty easy, but it&#8217;s much, much harder to guess a string of words, in the
correct order - especially if one or two of those words are obfuscated with
some special characters or numbers. Just a thought&#8230;. but interesting
nonetheless.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, I&#8217;ve been implementing an admin interface for a system that I want to
make more secure than the main application. The way I&#8217;ve chosen to do this is
to run some models that relate solely to the admin application (Authentication
and Authorization in particular), on a different database - let&#8217;s call it
&#8216;login&#8217;. This seems to be a reasonably common thing to do for security
purposes, and also for things like moving data from one database to another.
Once again though, I&#8217;ve been tempted into the potential nest of bugs that is
has_and_belongs_to_many - let me explain the schema first though: *
Administrators table - holds email, encrypted passwords and other data about
administrators * Roles table - holds the name of the role - used to authorizing
an administrator when performing an action. Each of these tables uses the line
<code>establish_connection 'login'</code> to connect to a different database than the
other models - this is the secure database that I want to leave purely for the
administrative application. So, given that I had an administrator that should
be given multiple roles, and obviously each role could have many
administrators, has_and_belongs_to_many seemed the obvious candidate - I didn&#8217;t
really want a model just for the association, and I would just need to write a
migration to create the join table. So, off, I went, and here&#8217;s what happened:
<code>ERROR: relation "administrators_roles" does not exist</code> i.e. - the
Administrator table exists, and the Role table exists, but the join table just
isn&#8217;t there. The first call for me was to take a look in the database, and make
sure that the table was there - which it was - and that migrations had
definitely run correctly and the schema was correct - which they were. After
much frustration, I found <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/%0Arubyonrails-talk/browse_thread/thread/7644d9e5f5c6e44a/%0A69c8cce4c39eb571?show_docid=69c8cce4c39eb571">this thread</a> which described the problems I
had been having - and I was vaguely satisfied to see that the problem wasn&#8217;t
really my fault. It seems that in some versions of Rails, ActiveRecord&#8217;s
has_and_belongs_to_many_association class doesn&#8217;t respect the database
connections that the models are trying to use - instead, it uses the universal
database connection to try and look up the join table - so, what was going
wrong was that ActiveRecord was looking in the development environment&#8217;s
database, when it should have been looking in the login database.
Unfortunately, short of updating your version of ActiveRecord/Rails or patching
this class, it seems that there isn&#8217;t really any way of avoiding this problem -
you have to drop back to using has_many :through with a Model representing your
join table. I can, though, at least vouch that once you have done this, it does
work as expected, which, in the end, is what we want. It still feels a bit
hacky though&#8230;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post is probably something more experienced RVM users will already know,
but I wanted to post this as it&#8217;s definitely my discovery of the week. When
throwing an .rvmrc file into a project, it&#8217;s a nice thing to do to write the
script correctly so that it will just work for other developers (As well as
telling you what gemset you&#8217;re using when you jump into the directory). In your
.rvmrc file, put something like this: <code>rvm use 1.9.2@gemset --create</code> &#8230;this
will attempt to use that gemset (Printing out a nice message telling you it&#8217;s
using that one as it does so), and will create it if it doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
