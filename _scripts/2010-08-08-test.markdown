Right team, listen up.


See, I'm quite a lazy blogger - it's just too much effort, and it never seems
to be shiny enough (Just check out my [old blog][1] out for proof.


I'm going to make this easy for all of us - I'll find cool stuff on the
Internet, or even in the [Real World][2] - and I'll share it here. It might be
a sentence, it might be a couple of paragraphs. No more pages-long blog posts
for me!
