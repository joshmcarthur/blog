<p>So I decided this evening to devote a couple of hours to giving back to Spree, after using the framework for a couple of work projects, and appreciating it for it's flexibility and extensibility.Â </p>&#13;
<p>I've developed an extension for Spree called Import Products. The source is based on a few bits of code that I have used for 2 projects now to import products into a Spree store from a comma-seperated values file (.CSV).</p>&#13;
<p>It's not perfect, but I'm happy with it as my first ever full contribution back to the Ruby on Rails community - I hope I have done a good enough job that it is useful to a couple of people.</p>&#13;
<p>If you want to check out the source code, it's on <a title="Import Products on Github" href="http://www.github.com/joshmcarthur/spree-import-products">github</a>.</p>&#13;
