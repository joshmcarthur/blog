<p>See, I'm quite a lazy blogger - it's just too much effort, and it never seems to be shiny enough (Just check out my <a title="My Old Blog" href="http://joshmcarthur.blogspot.com">old blog</a> out for proof.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I'm going to make this easy for all of us - I'll find cool stuff on the Internet, or even in the <a title="What's the Real World you ask?" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World">Real World</a> - and I'll share it here. It might be a sentence, it might be a couple of paragraphs. No more pages-long blog posts for me!</p>
