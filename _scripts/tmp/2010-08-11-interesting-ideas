<p>As part of my research for my last-minute essay rewrite, I happened to pick up an article covering an interview with <a title="David Heinemeier Hansson's Blog" target="_blank" href="http://www.loudthinking.com">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>, partner at <a href="37signals.com">37signals.com</a> and inventor of <a title="Ruby on Rails Website" target="_blank" href="rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>.</p>&#13;
<p>Hansson had some very interesting ideas, including the concept of reducing working hours in favour of creative quality, and the value of constraints over capital: "Excellent decisions come out of constraints...You must make compromises and decisions to cut down and release something that's simple and easy to use".</p>&#13;
<p>Hansson also had some interesting thoughts regarding the virtual workplace, suggesting that employees are happier in an environment of their choice, and a relaxed managerial style that reduces overhead and emphasises quality over quantity.</p>&#13;
<p>Definitely somebody to keep an eye on!</p>
