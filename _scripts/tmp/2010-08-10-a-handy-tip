<p>Just FYI...</p>&#13;
<p>See 2 posts ago - I am modifying this theme to make it work a bit nicer. Part of this included wanting to change some images. I was trying to just link to the images in CSS, but I found a much nicer way of doing it.</p>&#13;
<p>If you want to change your theme currently, you can often change a range of colors. There is a technique that allows you to prompt the user to upload an image file, rather than choosing a file:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>First, set up the parameter that the settings drop down will look for by making a meta tag in the document head that has it's name set as "image:YourTemplateImage", and the content set as the link to the image that should be used as default.</p>&#13;
<p>You can then use this image by referring to it in your CSS or HTML - for example:</p>&#13;
<p><code> #content { background: #FFF url({image:YourTemplateImage}) no-repeat top left; } </code></p>&#13;
<p>Very nice! Cheers to <a title="this blog post" target="_blank" href="http://www.tumblr.com/theme/222">this blog post</a> for the link.</p>
