<p>Finding appropriate domain names is a chore. There are so many rubbish parking sites out there that just ... shouldn't be. I dare say<a href="http://joshmcarthur.me"> joshmcarthur.me</a> could be considered one of them, since I could easily offload this onto Tumblr, but I enjoy having the unlimited capabilities a hosted site allows.</p>&#13;
<p>I think that domains should be treated in a similar way to Patents when they are registered. Patents require the applicant to justify to an overall authority (the <a href="http://www.iponz.govt.nz/cms">Intellectual Property Office</a> in NZ), why they should be allowed to own a particular patent.</p>&#13;
<p>If there was a justification scheme in place, it would not restrict the people who need domains - they would simply have to specify why they need the domain. What it would do is provide a decision framework on which to base decisions on registering domains to domain agents.</p>&#13;
<p>Why tie up a perfectly good address? Leave them open, and truly make it first-in, first-served, instead of the 'richest wins' model that exists at the moment.</p>
